## Leading the Playground: Where Fun Meets Responsibility

As Head Animator and Lead Coordinator at **Speelplein Weyneshof**, I orchestrated daily operations for a dynamic youth program, blending creativity with meticulous organization. My role spanned logistics, team leadership, and community engagement, ensuring a safe and enriching environment for children while supporting a team of volunteers.

### Key Responsibilities & Achievements
- **Planning & Coordination**: Designed weekly schedules and activity plans tailored to diverse age groups, balancing educational goals with fun.
- **Team Leadership**: Managed animators and volunteers, delegating tasks (activity supervision, safety checks) and fostering collaboration.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Liaised with parents, external vendors (caterers, transport providers), and local authorities.
- **Administration**: Oversaw registrations, attendance logs, and financial reports (cash flow tracking for activities).
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressed last-minute changes (weather disruptions, no-shows) with backup plans.

### Skills Gained
- **Adaptability**: Juggled multiple priorities like resolving conflicts while managing supply runs.
- **Crisis Management**: Handled emergencies (minor injuries, missing materials) calmly.
- **Ownership**: Responsible for keys, equipment, and overall safety - sharpening my attention to detail.

This experience honed my ability to **lead teams under pressure**, a skill I now apply to IT projects requiring coordination and clear communication.
