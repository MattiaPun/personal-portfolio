On December 3rd, I attended an insightful event hosted at Howest: **AI & Robotics – Meet the Experts!** This session featured two influential voices in the field — **Jo Lernout (BotRHere)** and **Stephen Lernout (Deontic)** — who shared their perspectives on combining innovation with ethical responsibility in artificial intelligence.

### Key Themes from the Talk

The presentation focused on two essential areas that are increasingly relevant in the AI landscape:

#### AI Compliance: Ethics Meets Regulation
- The speakers stressed the growing importance of **compliance frameworks** in AI development.
- We explored how responsible AI isn’t just a buzzword, but a **practical necessity** for trustworthy systems.
- From GDPR to upcoming EU AI regulations, the talk highlighted what it means to build compliant systems from day one.

#### Practical Applications of AI & Robotics
- We saw **real-world case studies** of robotics and AI integration in both industrial and consumer spaces.
- Jo and Stephen offered a look into the current state of the field — not just theoretical potential, but **solutions already in use**.
- These included examples from healthcare, automation, and interactive robotics.

### Why This Event Mattered
This talk went beyond surface-level AI trends. It emphasized the **balance between rapid technological innovation and societal responsibility**. As students and future developers, it reminded us that **technical skill must be paired with ethical awareness** — especially in fields as impactful as AI and robotics.

Whether you’re focused on software, engineering, ethics, or entrepreneurship, this session offered valuable insights into where the world of intelligent systems is heading — and how we can help shape it responsibly.
