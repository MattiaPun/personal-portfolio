This year, I took on my first major cybersecurity challenge by participating in the **Cyber Security Challenge Belgium** qualifiers with a teammate from Howest. While we didn't advance to the finals, the experience proved invaluable for my development as a security professional.

### Why We Competed
- To test our skills beyond classroom scenarios
- Experience real-world security challenges
- Learn from Belgium's cybersecurity community

### What We Gained
1. **Practical Application**  
   Finally used my Wireshark knowledge on actual network forensics challenges

2. **Teamwork Dynamics**  
   Learned to divide tasks efficiently (I handled web apps while my partner focused on forensics)

3. **Time Pressure Management**  
   Discovered how quickly 48 hours disappears during a CTF

### Our Biggest Lesson
The competition revealed gaps in our **Active Directory attack knowledge** - we spent hours on Kerberoasting when other attack vectors existed. This motivated me to:

- Build a dedicated AD lab at home
- Practicing on websites like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**

### For Future Participants
Don't let intimidation stop you. The qualifiers alone taught me more about practical security than months of lectures. I'll definitely be back next year with sharper skills and better preparation.
