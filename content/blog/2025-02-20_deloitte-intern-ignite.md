### A Welcome Change of Pace

After a few weeks of settling into my internship at Deloitte, I had the opportunity to attend **Interns Ignite 2025**, an event designed to bring together current, future, and former interns. It was a welcome change of pace—a chance to step back from the day-to-day work and connect with others who are going through (or have already gone through) the same experience.

### The Venue and Atmosphere

The event took place at the **Gateway building in Zaventem**, which, despite being my usual office, felt completely different when filled with so many new faces and a buzzing, enthusiastic atmosphere. It kicked off with a **panel discussion** featuring past interns who have grown into full-time roles. Hearing them talk candidly about their own learning curves, challenges, and turning points made a big impact. It reminded me that everyone starts somewhere—and growth comes through asking questions, being proactive, and staying curious.

### Interactive Activities

We also had the chance to explore the building in a more interactive way through a **Deloitte-themed quiz** scattered across various locations. It was a fun way to learn some trivia about the company (and to see how competitive interns can get when there are bragging rights on the line).

### Keynote Inspiration

The highlight of the day for me, though, was the **keynote speech by Sofie Lenaerts**, the first woman in the Benelux to climb the Seven Summits. Her story was incredible—not just because of the physical challenge, but because of how she tied her experience back to the professional world. She spoke about resilience, decision-making under pressure, and committing to long-term goals, even when things get tough. It resonated with me, especially as someone still figuring out my path and navigating new responsibilities.

### Wrapping Up the Day

The event ended on a relaxed note with a **pizza buffet and networking session**. It was a great chance to talk with interns from other teams and offices, compare experiences, and even share a few laughs about the little things we’re all still figuring out.

Overall, Interns Ignite wasn’t just a fun day—it reminded me that this internship is part of a much bigger journey. It gave me new perspective, renewed motivation, and a sense of community within Deloitte that I hadn't fully felt before.
