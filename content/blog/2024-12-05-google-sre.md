Yesterday, Howest hosted an exceptional guest lecture featuring **Stefaan V.** and **Tijl Van den Broeck** from Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. Here are my key takeaways from this enlightening session:

### What is SRE?
Google defines Site Reliability Engineering as:
- A software engineering approach to operations
- Focused on creating scalable, reliable systems
- Balancing feature development with system stability

### Highlights from the Lecture
The speakers covered:
- **Error Budgets**: How Google quantifies acceptable downtime
- **Automation First**: Eliminating toil through tooling
- **Monitoring Philosophy**: The "Four Golden Signals" (Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation)
- **Postmortem Culture**: Blameless analysis of incidents

### Interactive Demo
The most engaging part was a live demo of:
- Google's internal monitoring tools
- An SRE "ghack" scenario (similar to their Cloud Summit presentation)
- Real-world troubleshooting workflows

### Why This Matters
As future engineers, understanding SRE principles helps us:
- Design more resilient systems
- Appreciate the ops side of DevOps
- Implement better monitoring from day one

While I can't share Google's proprietary details, the core concepts demonstrated why SRE has become industry standard for tech giants and startups alike.
