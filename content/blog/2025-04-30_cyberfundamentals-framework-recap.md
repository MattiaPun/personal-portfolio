On April 29, I attended **Tech&Meet: CyFun – CyberFundamentals Framework**, a hands-on cybersecurity session hosted at Howest. The evening focused on **practical, real-world applications** of essential cybersecurity concepts — not just the theory.

### Topics Covered

We explored key phases of modern cybersecurity practice:
- **Risk Identification**: Understanding where your vulnerabilities are before attackers do.
- **Threat Detection**: How to spot malicious activity early using tools and monitoring techniques.
- **Incident Response**: What to do when something goes wrong — fast and effectively.
- **Recovery**: Strategies to get back on track while learning from incidents.

The workshop emphasized **actionable frameworks** like the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) and [CIS Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls). These are widely used by organizations worldwide and gave us a clear methodology to map our thinking and processes.

## Guest Expert: Johan Klykens from the CCB

A highlight of the event was the session by **Johan Klykens**, a cybersecurity expert from the **Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB)**. He shared valuable field experience and insights into how Belgium is addressing cyber threats on a national level, making the event even more relevant and impactful.

## Why It Mattered

For students and professionals alike, the CyFun session delivered:
- Practical know-how you can apply right away
- Familiarity with the frameworks used in the industry
- Insight from someone working at the highest level of national cybersecurity

This wasn’t just a lecture — it was an interactive learning experience that connected the dots between academic knowledge and operational cybersecurity.

**If you're serious about cybersecurity**, understanding these frameworks is essential — and events like CyFun are a great way to get started or stay sharp.
