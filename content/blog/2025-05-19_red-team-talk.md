In a special episode of the *Howest IT Student Podcast*, hosts Joren and I — both Cyber Security students — sit down with an experienced red teamer from Deloitte Belgium to explore the exciting and ever-evolving world of offensive security.

The episode **Red Team Talk** takes listeners on a guided tour behind the scenes of professional hacking. From personal career paths to real-world red teaming operations, the episode offers insights into what it means to simulate cyberattacks, test organizational defenses, and continuously adapt in a field that never stands still.

The conversation dives into:

- How a strong interest in hacking led our guest to a red team role
- The difference between offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) work
- The importance of self-study, labs, and practical experience beyond the classroom
- Learning through doing: the real way most cybersecurity professionals grow
- The value of coding and understanding low-level systems like Linux
- The real-life gap between certifications, theory, and actual field work
- And a lot more...

This episode was created as part of a course project and aims to reflect the curiosity and passion that drive students toward a future in cybersecurity. Our interview style focused on personal experiences and lessons learned — rather than technical deep dives — to make it accessible and inspiring for fellow students and newcomers alike.

If you’re curious about what it’s like to break into the cybersecurity field, or just want to hear what red teaming looks like from the inside, give this one a listen.
