I'm a cybersecurity specialist passionate about offensive security, automation, and building secure, resilient systems. I have a strong focus on offensive security, system hardening, and secure infrastructure design. My experience spans penetration testing (web, network, and system), reverse engineering, and the implementation of secure networking solutions such as VPNs, firewalls, and DNS-based filtering.

<br>

I have a deep understanding of Linux environments, where I regularly perform vulnerability assessments, analyze system behavior, and develop custom scripts to automate security tasks. I also work with containerized applications and DevSecOps pipelines, integrating security into every stage of the development and deployment process. Whether conducting audits, simulating real-world attacks, or improving defense mechanisms, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, precision, and a commitment to building more secure digital systems."
