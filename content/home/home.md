My experience spans penetration testing (web, network, and system), reverse engineering, and the implementation of secure networking solutions such as VPNs, firewalls, and DNS-based filtering.</br>I have a deep understanding of Linux environments, where I regularly perform vulnerability assessments, analyze system behavior, and develop custom scripts to automate security tasks. I also work with containerized applications and DevSecOps pipelines, integrating security into every stage of the development and deployment process.</br>Whether conducting audits, simulating real-world attacks, or improving defense mechanisms, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, precision, and a commitment to building more secure digital systems."
